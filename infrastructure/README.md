# Deployment/Infrastructure

BuildPipeline is built, tested and deployed to AWS by CodePipeline and CodeBuild. Artifacts are served from S3. CloudFront is used as a CDN. Route 53 is used for DNS.

To deploy to AWS, you must:

1. Install [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) and make sure it is in your PATH.
1. Set your AWS credentials using one of the following options:
   1. Set your credentials as the environment variables `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`.
   1. Run `aws configure` and fill in the details it asks for.
   1. Run on an EC2 instance with an IAM Role.
   1. Run via CodeBuild or ECS Task with an IAM Role (see [buildspec-test.yml](../buildspec-test.yml) for workaround)

## Manually created components

The following infrastructure components should be created manually and passed to Terraform via the appropriate variables in the appropriate buildspec declaration:

- Route53 hosted zone
- ACM Certificate in US East (N. Virginia) region for CloudFront
- build-approvals SNS topic and subscriptions
- shared and buildpipeline KMS keys
- shared/github-token and buildpipeline/app-secret SSM Parameter Store parameters encrypted with the appropriate KMS key

## Initial deploy

There is a chicken and egg situation - CodeBuild and CodePipeline will eventually build, test and deploy the project but this can only happen after the CodeBuild and CodePipeline projects have been created. Terraform needs to be run initially to create the CodeBuild and CodePipeline projects in each account/environment. CodeBuild and CodePipeline will then build, test and deploy every commit on the specified branch of the GitHub repo.

**All commands below must be run from the root directory.**

1. Update and export all environment variables specified in the appropriate buildspec declaration (check all phases) and bash scripts
1. `infrastructure/deploy-infrastructure.bash`

Exporting the environment variables specified in a buildspec declaration is tedious and time-consuming. The bash script below utilises a YAML parser called [shyaml](https://github.com/0k/shyaml) and automates the process (shyaml must be installed before using). Environment variables specified in buildspec phases or bash scripts will still need to be exported manually.

```sh
export $(
  cat BUILDSPEC_FILE_PATH |
  shyaml get-values-0 env.variables |
  while IFS='' read -r -d '' key && IFS='' read -r -d '' value; do
    echo $key=$value
  done
)
```

**All commands below must be run in the /infrastructure directory.**

## Manually deploying infrastructure

1. Update and export all environment variables specified in the appropriate buildspec declaration (check all phases) and bash scripts
1. Initialise Terraform:

```terraform
terraform init \
  -backend-config 'bucket=YOUR_S3_BUCKET' \
  -backend-config 'key=YOUR_S3_KEY' \
  -backend-config 'region=YOUR_REGION' \
  -get=true \
  -upgrade=true
```

1. `terraform plan -out main.tfplan`
1. `terraform apply main.tfplan`

## Manually updating infrastructure

1. Update and export all environment variables specified in the appropriate buildspec declaration (check all phases) and bash scripts
1. Make necessary infrastructure code changes.
1. Initialise Terraform:

```terraform
terraform init \
  -backend-config 'bucket=YOUR_S3_BUCKET' \
  -backend-config 'key=YOUR_S3_KEY' \
  -backend-config 'region=YOUR_REGION' \
  -get=true \
  -upgrade=true
```

1. `terraform plan -out main.tfplan`
1. `terraform apply main.tfplan`

## Manually destroying infrastructure (use with care)

1. Update and export all environment variables specified in the appropriate buildspec declaration (check all phases) and bash scripts
1. Initialise Terraform:

```terraform
terraform init \
  -backend-config 'bucket=YOUR_S3_BUCKET' \
  -backend-config 'key=YOUR_S3_KEY' \
  -backend-config 'region=YOUR_REGION' \
  -get=true \
  -upgrade=true
```

1. `terraform destroy`
